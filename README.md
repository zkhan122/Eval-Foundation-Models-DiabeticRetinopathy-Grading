"Evaluating Foundation Model for Interpretable Diabetic Retinopathy Grading" By Zayaan Khan


Foundation models also known as large X models (LxM) are deep learning models which have been trained
on large datasets to be applied across various downstream tasks

Examples include ChatGPT, BERT, CLIP, Stable Diffusion.

Aim: To evaluate the performance of retinal-specific foundation models such as RETFound , FLAIR and others
for the downstream task of diabetic retinopathy severity grading.
